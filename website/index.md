## Who Ordered This?

This is a collection of various useful Javascript utility functions that
I've written over the years.

Many of them are wrappers for simple code snippets that exist only to make
my code more self-documenting and/or easier to read.  Some are more
complicated and are the kind of things that I prefer not to copy-and-paste
into different projects.  You'll find similar functions in other libraries
like [underscore](https://underscorejs.org/) and [Lodash](https://lodash.com/).
These just happen to be the ones I tend to use all the time.

## Opinionated and Selfish Software

::: warning WARNING - People Who Share Their Source Code Do Not Owe You Anything!
This is OSS: **Open Source Software** that you can freely download, use and adapt
if you want to. But here OSS also stands for **Opinionated and Selfish Software**.

It doesn't set out to please all the people, all the time. On the contrary,
it is designed to please one person (me) most of the time. I wrote it to help
me get my job done.  If it helps you get your job done then great.  But please
don't complain if it doesn't do what you want.  It's not my job to help you
do your job.
