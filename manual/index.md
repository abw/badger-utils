This is the manual for the `badger-utils` Javascript module.

It is a collection of various useful utility functions that I've written
over the years.

Many of them are wrappers for simple code snippets that exist only to make
my code more self-documenting and/or easier to read.  Some are more
complicated and are the kind of things that I prefer not to copy-and-paste
into different projects.  You'll find similar functions in other libraries
like [underscore](https://underscorejs.org/) and [Lodash](https://lodash.com/).
These just happen to be the ones I tend to use all the time.
