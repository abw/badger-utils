# badger-utils

This contains a number of Javascript utility functions that
I tend to use in most of my Javascript projects.

Some of these functions date back to long, long ago, before
libraries like [underscore](https://underscorejs.org/) and
[lodash](https://lodash.com/) existed.  There probably isn't
much in here that isn't already covered by those libraries.

For new projects it's probably best to start out using one
of those if you don't mind the overhead.
